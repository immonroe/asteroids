# asteroids

Overview
This project is a Python-based clone of the classic arcade game Asteroids. The game involves controlling a spaceship to shoot and destroy asteroids that drift across the screen. The goal is to survive as long as possible by avoiding collisions with asteroids and enemies.

## Features
- Spaceship Control: Move the spaceship using arrow keys and fire bullets with the spacebar.
- Asteroid Generation: Randomly generated asteroids with varying sizes and speeds.
- Collision Detection: Real-time detection and response to collisions between the spaceship, bullets, and asteroids.
- Game Over Condition: The game ends when the spaceship collides with an asteroid.

## Installation
To run the game, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asteroids-clone.git
cd asteroids-clone
```

Install dependencies - Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage
- Use the WASD keys to control the spaceship.
- Press the spacebar to shoot bullets.
- Avoid collisions with asteroids to keep playing.

## Future Features
-  Add a scoring system
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield/speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped
